# Frontend Libraries Explorer

This project aims to be a full-stack application that explores different web dev libraries. This is part of a larger Web Dev Explorer series of repositories.
The frontend uses mainly Next JS (page directory) with Tailwind and Typescript, but projects inside it may use a range of different technologies.
The backend primarily uses Node JS with Typescript, but specific technologies may vary. The backend will rely on the API folder within Next JS
